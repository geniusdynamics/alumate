## Test Reporting

### Automated Reports

The testing suite generates comprehensive reports:

1. **Test Execution Report**: Pass/fail status, execution times
2. **Coverage Report**: Code coverage analysis with HTML output
3. **Performance Report**: Benchmark results and bottleneck analysis
4. **Security Report**: Vulnerability assessment results

### Report Locations

```
tests/reports/
├── latest_report.json       # Comprehensive test report
├── junit.xml               # JUnit format for CI/CD
├── testdox.html           # Human-readable test documentation
├── coverage/              # HTML coverage reports
│   └── index.html
└── performance_report.json # Performance benchmarks
```

### Key Metrics Tracked

- **Test Coverage**: Line, method, and class coverage
- **Execution Time**: Per test and suite timing
- **Memory Usage**: Peak and average memory consumption
- **Database Queries**: Query count and performance
- **Security Score**: Vulnerability assessment rating

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: 8.3
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: composer install
      - name: Run Tests
        run: ./run-tests.sh --suite all --coverage --report
```

### Quality Gates

Tests must pass these quality gates:

- ✅ All tests pass (0 failures)
- ✅ Code coverage ≥ 80%
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ No code style violations

## Test Data Management

### Factories and Seeders

Comprehensive test data generation:

```php
// Graduate factory with realistic data
Graduate::factory()->count(1000)->create([
    'skills' => ['PHP', 'Laravel', 'JavaScript'],
    'employment_status' => ['status' => 'unemployed'],
    'job_search_active' => true
]);

// Job factory with matching requirements
Job::factory()->active()->create([
    'required_skills' => ['PHP', 'Laravel'],
    'salary_range' => [45000, 65000]
]);
```

### Database Isolation

Each test runs in isolation:

- Fresh database migrations
- Transactional rollbacks
- Tenant-specific data separation
- No cross-test contamination

## Performance Monitoring
