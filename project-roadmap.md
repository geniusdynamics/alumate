## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Performance**: High-volume template queries may impact performance
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing, caching strategies, and query optimization
   - **Contingency**: Scale database resources and implement read replicas

2. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Complex tenant boundaries may introduce data leakage
   - **Mitigation**: Rigorous tenant scoping and comprehensive integration testing
   - **Contingency**: Enhanced security audits and additional validation layers

3. **Frontend Complexity**: Rich template editor may have browser compatibility issues
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement and thorough cross-browser testing
   - **Contingency**: Simplified fallback interfaces and graceful degradation

### Schedule Risks
1. **Dependency Delays**: Integration with existing systems may take longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Early integration planning and mock service development
   - **Contingency**: Parallel development tracks and buffer time allocation

2. **Feature Creep**: Additional requirements may emerge during development
   - **Mitigation**: Strict scope management and change control processes
   - **Contingency**: Flexible sprint planning and phased delivery approach

### Resource Risks
1. **Team Availability**: Key personnel may become unavailable during critical periods
   - **Mitigation**: Cross-training and knowledge sharing initiatives
   - **Contingency**: External contractor support and skill redundancy

2. **Third-Party Dependencies**: External services may introduce delays or limitations
   - **Mitigation**: Vendor evaluation and contingency planning
   - **Contingency**: Alternative service providers and fallback strategies
