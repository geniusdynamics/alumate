# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Calendar Integration Service currently has several unimplemented methods that are critical for full calendar functionality. This feature will complete the implementation of all missing methods in the CalendarIntegrationService, ensuring full calendar synchronization, event management, and multi-provider support for Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar, and CalDAV.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want all calendar integration methods to be fully implemented, so that I can reliably sync events across different calendar providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their Apple Calendar THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch Apple Calendar events
2. WHEN a user connects their CalDAV calendar THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch CalDAV events
3. WHEN the system tests calendar connections THEN it SHALL properly validate Google, Outlook, Apple, and CalDAV connections
4. WHEN Google access tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them
5. WHEN external events are synced THEN the system SHALL create or update local events appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want calendar events to be properly synchronized across all my connected calendars, so that my schedule is consistent everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a platform event is created THEN the system SHALL sync it to all connected external calendars
2. WHEN a user is invited to an event THEN the system SHALL create the event in their connected calendars
3. WHEN email invites are needed THEN the system SHALL send properly formatted calendar invitations
4. WHEN fetching busy times THEN the system SHALL retrieve accurate availability data from all providers
5. WHEN finding available slots THEN the system SHALL calculate free time periods correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for all calendar operations, so that I can troubleshoot integration issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN connection tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
4. WHEN external API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic
5. WHEN calendar sync encounters errors THEN the system SHALL update connection status appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive calendar integration testing, so that I can ensure all calendar features work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN all calendar integration methods SHALL have unit test coverage
2. WHEN testing calendar connections THEN the system SHALL validate all provider integrations
3. WHEN testing event synchronization THEN the system SHALL verify bidirectional sync functionality
4. WHEN testing availability calculations THEN the system SHALL ensure accurate time slot detection
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL handle all failure cases appropriately
