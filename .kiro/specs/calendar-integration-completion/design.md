# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the completion of the CalendarIntegrationService by implementing all missing methods. The service currently has placeholder comments for 13 unimplemented methods that are essential for full calendar functionality. The implementation will provide complete support for Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar, and CalDAV integration.

## Architecture

The CalendarIntegrationService follows a provider-based architecture where each calendar provider (Google, Outlook, Apple, CalDAV) has specific implementation methods. The service uses a factory pattern to handle different providers and maintains consistent interfaces across all calendar operations.

### Key Components

1. **Provider-Specific Event Fetchers**: Methods to retrieve events from each calendar provider
2. **Connection Testers**: Methods to validate calendar connections for each provider
3. **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh for OAuth-based providers
4. **Event Synchronization**: Bidirectional sync between platform and external calendars
5. **Availability Calculation**: Time slot detection and busy time analysis
6. **Notification System**: Email invites and calendar notifications

## Components and Interfaces

### Missing Method Implementations

#### 1. Apple Calendar Integration
- `fetchAppleEvents(CalendarConnection $connection): Collection`
- `testAppleConnection(CalendarConnection $connection): bool`

Apple Calendar integration will use CalDAV protocol since Apple Calendar supports CalDAV access.

#### 2. CalDAV Integration
- `fetchCalDAVEvents(CalendarConnection $connection): Collection`
- `testCalDAVConnection(CalendarConnection $connection): bool`

CalDAV integration will use HTTP requests with proper authentication to interact with CalDAV servers.

#### 3. Connection Testing
- `testGoogleConnection(CalendarConnection $connection): bool`
- `testOutlookConnection(CalendarConnection $connection): bool`

Connection testing will make lightweight API calls to verify credentials and connectivity.

#### 4. Token Management
- `refreshGoogleToken(CalendarConnection $connection): void`

Token refresh will handle OAuth token renewal for Google Calendar connections.

#### 5. Event Management
- `createOrUpdateEvent(CalendarConnection $connection, array $externalEvent): Event`
- `syncEventToExternalCalendars(Event $event): void`
- `createEventInUserCalendar(User $user, Event $event): void`

Event management will handle creation, updates, and synchronization across platforms.

#### 6. Communication
- `sendEmailInvite(Event $event, string $email): void`

Email invites will send calendar invitations using Laravel's mail system.

#### 7. Availability Calculation
- `fetchBusyTimes(CalendarConnection $connection, Carbon $startDate, Carbon $endDate): Collection`
- `findSlotsInDay(Carbon $dayStart, Carbon $dayEnd, Collection $busyTimes, int $durationMinutes): Collection`

Availability calculation will analyze calendar data to find free time slots.

## Data Models

### CalendarConnection Model Enhancements

The CalendarConnection model will need an `active()` scope method to filter active connections.

### Event Model Structure

Events will maintain consistent structure across all providers with these fields:
- external_id (provider-specific ID)
- title
- description
- start_time
- end_time
- location
- attendees
- provider metadata

## Error Handling

### Exception Types
- `CalendarConnectionException`: For connection failures
- `CalendarSyncException`: For synchronization errors
- `TokenRefreshException`: For OAuth token issues
- `CalendarProviderException`: For provider-specific errors

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Connection status updates for failed operations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each method independently with mocked dependencies
- Validate error handling scenarios
- Test data transformation and mapping
- Verify token refresh logic

### Integration Tests
- Test actual API connections (with test accounts)
- Validate end-to-end event synchronization
- Test availability calculation accuracy
- Verify email invite functionality

### Mock Strategy
- Mock external API responses for consistent testing
- Create test fixtures for different calendar providers
- Simulate various error conditions
- Test rate limiting and throttling scenarios

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- All credentials encrypted at rest
- Secure token storage and refresh
- Proper OAuth flow implementation
- Credential rotation support

### API Security
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Proper authentication headers
- SSL/TLS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed calendar data
- Implement intelligent sync intervals
- Use background jobs for heavy operations
- Optimize database queries for availability checks

### Rate Limiting
- Respect provider API rate limits
- Implement exponential backoff
- Queue operations during high usage
- Monitor API usage metrics
