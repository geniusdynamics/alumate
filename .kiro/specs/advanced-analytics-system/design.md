# Advanced Analytics System Design

## Overview

The Advanced Analytics System is a comprehensive user behavior analysis platform that provides heat mapping, A/B testing, conversion funnel analysis, session recordings, and predictive analytics capabilities. Building upon the existing 98% complete analytics foundation in the Alumate platform, this system extends the current capabilities with advanced user behavior tracking, conversion optimization, and predictive career analytics.

The system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing Laravel 12 multi-tenant architecture while providing real-time insights and privacy-compliant data collection. It leverages the platform's existing analytics infrastructure including the 15+ chart types, real-time performance monitoring, and predictive analytics with 75% job placement accuracy.

The system will be built as a modular enhancement to the existing alumni tracking platform, extending the current analytics service layer, queue system, and WebSocket/Pusher real-time capabilities. It will provide both API endpoints for programmatic access and Vue 3 components for interactive dashboards, building upon the existing comprehensive reporting system.

### Data Flow Architecture

The system follows an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured, processed asynchronously, and aggregated for analysis:

1. **Event Capture**: JavaScript tracking code captures user interactions
2. **Event Processing**: Laravel jobs process events asynchronously
3. **Data Aggregation**: Scheduled jobs aggregate data for reporting
4. **Real-time Updates**: Broadcasting provides live dashboard updates
5. **Machine Learning**: Background jobs train predictive models

### Multi-Tenant Considerations

The analytics system will respect the existing tenant isolation:
- All analytics data will be scoped to the current tenant
- Database tables will include tenant_id columns
- Service classes will automatically filter by tenant context
- API endpoints will enforce tenant-based access control

```json
{
  "event_type": "page_view|click|scroll|form_submit|custom",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-23T10:30:00Z",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "optional_uuid",
  "page_url": "/landing-page",
  "event_data": {
    "element_selector": ".cta-button",
    "element_text": "Sign Up Now",
    "x_coordinate": 150,
    "y_coordinate": 300,
    "viewport_width": 1920,
    "viewport_height": 1080,
    "scroll_depth": 75,
    "form_fields": ["email", "name"],
    "custom_properties": {}
  },
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
  "device_type": "desktop|mobile|tablet",
  "traffic_source": "organic|paid|direct|referral"
}
```

### Heat Map Data Structure

Heat map data is stored with precise coordinate information and contextual metadata:

```json
{
  "page_url": "/landing-page",
  "interactions": [
    {
      "type": "click|hover|scroll",
      "x": 150,
      "y": 300,
      "element_selector": ".cta-button",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-23T10:30:00Z",
      "viewport_dimensions": {
        "width": 1920,
        "height": 1080
      },
      "device_type": "desktop",
      "user_segment": "returning_visitor"
    }
  ]
}
```

### A/B Test Configuration

A/B tests are configured with flexible variant definitions and conversion tracking:

```json
{
  "name": "Landing Page CTA Test",
  "variants": [
    {
      "id": "control",
      "name": "Original Button",
      "traffic_percentage": 50,
      "changes": []
    },
    {
      "id": "variant_a",
      "name": "Green Button",
      "traffic_percentage": 50,
      "changes": [
        {
          "selector": ".cta-button",
          "property": "background-color",
          "value": "#28a745"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "conversion_goal": {
    "type": "event",
    "event_name": "form_submit",
    "page_url": "/thank-you"
  },
  "statistical_settings": {
    "confidence_level": 95,
    "minimum_sample_size": 1000,
    "minimum_effect_size": 0.05
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Error Handling

The JavaScript tracking code implements robust error handling:
- Network failure retry logic with exponential backoff
- Local storage fallback for offline scenarios
- Graceful degradation when tracking fails
- Error reporting to monitoring systems

### Server-Side Error Handling

Laravel services implement comprehensive error handling:
- Database transaction rollbacks for data consistency
- Queue job retry mechanisms with dead letter queues
- Validation error responses with detailed messages
- Logging integration for debugging and monitoring

### Privacy and Compliance Errors

Special handling for privacy-related scenarios:
- Consent withdrawal processing
- Data deletion request handling
- Geographic restriction compliance
- Age verification failures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Each service class will have comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Event processing logic
- Statistical calculations
- Data aggregation algorithms
- Privacy compliance functions

Example test structure:
```php
describe('AnalyticsService', function () {
    it('processes page view events correctly', function () {
        // Test event processing logic
    });
    
    it('respects tenant isolation', function () {
        // Test multi-tenant data separation
    });
    
    it('handles invalid event data gracefully', function () {
        // Test error handling
    });
});
```

### Feature Testing

API endpoints will be tested with realistic scenarios:
