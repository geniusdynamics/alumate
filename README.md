## 🚀 Laravel Boost MCP Integration

This project is enhanced with **Laravel Boost**, providing AI-assisted development through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. Laravel Boost offers 15+ specialized tools for Laravel development and comprehensive AI guidelines.

### 🛠️ **Available MCP Tools**

#### **Database Operations**

- `database_schema` - Inspect database structure and relationships
- `database_query` - Execute queries for data analysis  
- `database_connections` - Check connection configurations

#### **Application Inspection**

- `application_info` - Get PHP/Laravel versions, packages, and models
- `list_routes` - Inspect all application routes
- `get_config` - Read configuration values using dot notation
- `list_artisan_commands` - See available Artisan commands

#### **Development Tools**

- `tinker` - Execute code in Laravel's context
- `search_docs` - Query Laravel documentation for your specific versions
- `read_log_entries` - Check application logs
- `last_error` - Get recent error information
- `browser_logs` - Read frontend logs and errors

### 🔧 **Environment-Specific Configuration**

This project uses a custom PHP path and development setup. The MCP configuration is optimized for:

- **PHP Path**: `D:\DevCenter\xampp\php-8.3.23\php.exe`
- **Project Root**: `D:\DevCenter\abuilds\alumate`
- **Custom Artisan**: Uses `artisan.ps1` for PowerShell compatibility

#### **MCP Configuration** (`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "laravel-boost": {
      "command": "D:\\DevCenter\\xampp\\php-8.3.23\\php.exe",
      "args": ["artisan", "boost:mcp"],
      "cwd": "D:\\DevCenter\\abuilds\\alumate",
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "application_info",
        "database_schema", 
        "list_routes",
        "get_config",
        "search_docs",
        "list_artisan_commands",
        "tinker",
        "read_log_entries",
        "last_error"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 💡 **Using Laravel Boost with AI**

#### **Example Prompts:**

```
# Database Analysis
"Use database_schema to show me the analytics tables, then suggest optimizations"

# Route Inspection  
"Use list_routes to show analytics endpoints, check for missing routes"

# Configuration Check
"Use get_config to check database settings, recommend performance improvements"

# Documentation Search
"Use search_docs to find Laravel 12 service class best practices"

# Application Context
"Use application_info to understand our setup, suggest beneficial packages"
```

### 🎯 **AI Guidelines**

Custom AI guidelines are available in `.ai/guidelines/kiro-laravel-boost.blade.php` covering:

- **Laravel 12 Best Practices**: Service classes, validation, caching
- **Vue 3 + TypeScript Patterns**: Composition API, reactive data
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Tenant isolation, scoped queries
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Chart components, data visualization
- **Testing Approach**: Pest PHP, factories, feature tests
- **Performance Optimization**: Eager loading, indexing, queuing

### 🔄 **Troubleshooting MCP**

If MCP connection fails:

1. **Check PHP Path**: Ensure `D:\DevCenter\xampp\php-8.3.23\php.exe` exists
2. **Verify Working Directory**: Confirm project is at `D:\DevCenter\abuilds\alumate`  
3. **Test Manually**: Run `D:\DevCenter\xampp\php-8.3.23\php.exe artisan boost:mcp --version`
4. **Alternative Config**: Use PowerShell wrapper in `.kiro/settings/mcp-alternative.json`
5. **Batch File**: Use `boost-mcp.bat` for simplified execution
