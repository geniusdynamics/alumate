# Email Integration System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Email Integration System as specified in the requirements located in `.kiro/specs/email-integration-system/`. The system will provide automated follow-up sequences and email marketing capabilities for leads captured through landing pages, enabling personalized, audience-specific email campaigns that nurture leads through the conversion funnel.

This implementation follows the specifications detailed in:
- Requirements: `.kiro/specs/email-integration-system/requirements.md`
- Design: `.kiro/specs/email-integration-system/design.md`
- Implementation Tasks: `.kiro/specs/email-integration-system/tasks.md`

## System Analysis

### Existing System Capabilities

The current system already has:
- Email campaign management with `EmailCampaign`, `EmailTemplate`, and `EmailAutomationRule` models
- Email marketing service with provider integration support
- Basic automation rules for triggering emails based on events
- Email tracking and analytics capabilities
- Multi-tenant architecture support

### Gaps to Address

The new requirements introduce several capabilities not fully covered by the existing system:

1. **Email Sequences**: Automated drip campaigns with timing controls (Requirement 1, 7)
2. **Lead Enrollment Management**: Tracking individual lead progress through sequences
3. **Behavior-Based Triggers**: Page visits, form abandonment, resource downloads (Requirement 3)
4. **Advanced Personalization**: Dynamic content based on lead data and behavior (Requirement 2)
5. **Compliance Management**: Enhanced unsubscribe and preference handling (Requirement 6)
6. **CRM Integration**: Deeper lead synchronization and scoring (Requirement 5)
7. **Advanced Analytics**: Funnel tracking from email to conversion (Requirement 4, 9)

## Database Schema Design

Based on the design specification in `.kiro/specs/email-integration-system/design.md`, the following tables are required:

### New Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_sequences (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    audience_type ENUM('individual', 'institutional', 'employer'),
    trigger_type ENUM('form_submission', 'page_visit', 'behavior', 'manual'),
    trigger_conditions JSON,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_tenant_audience (tenant_id, audience_type),
    INDEX idx_active (is_active)
);
```

#### sequence_emails
```sql
CREATE TABLE sequence_emails (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    sequence_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    template_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    subject_line VARCHAR(25),
    delay_hours INT DEFAULT 0,
    send_order INT NOT NULL,

```

## Database Migrations

The following migration files need to be created according to the implementation tasks in `.kiro/specs/email-integration-system/tasks.md`:

1. `2025_09_05_0000_create_email_sequences_table.php` - Creates the email_sequences table
2. `2025_09_05_0001_create_sequence_emails_table.php` - Creates the sequence_emails table
3. `2025_09_05_0002_create_sequence_enrollments_table.php` - Creates the sequence_enrollments table
4. `2025_09_05_0003_create_email_sends_table.php` - Creates the email_sends table

Each migration will follow Laravel's migration pattern with proper up() and down() methods for installation and rollback.

## Model Implementations
