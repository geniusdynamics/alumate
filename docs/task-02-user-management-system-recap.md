## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced User Model
```php
class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasFactory, Notifiable, HasRoles, HasDataTable, SoftDeletes;

    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 'email', 'password', 'phone', 'avatar',
        'institution_id', 'profile_data', 'preferences',
        'is_suspended', 'suspended_at', 'suspension_reason',
        'last_login_at', 'last_activity_at', 'two_factor_enabled',
        'timezone', 'language', 'status'
    ];

    // Relationships, scopes, accessors, and methods
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control
```php
// Policy-based authorization
class UserPolicy
{
    public function view(User $user, User $model): bool
    {
        if ($user->hasRole('super-admin')) return true;
        if ($user->id === $model->id) return true;
        if ($user->hasRole('institution-admin') && 
            $user->institution_id === $model->institution_id) return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Activity Tracking Middleware
```php
class TrackUserActivity
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
    {
        $response = $next($request);
        
        if (Auth::check()) {
            Auth::user()->updateLastActivity();
            $this->logActivity($request, Auth::user());
        }
        
        return $response;
    }
}
```
