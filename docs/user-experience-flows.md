## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Include Integration Components**: Add the three main integration components to relevant pages:
   ```vue
   <UserFlowIntegration />
   <RealTimeUpdates :show-activity-feed="true" />
   <CrossFeatureConnections context="page-context" :context-data="data" />
   ```

2. **Use UserFlowIntegration Service**: Import and use the service for cross-feature actions:
   ```javascript
   import userFlowIntegration from '@/services/UserFlowIntegration'
   
   // Example: Create post with timeline refresh
   await userFlowIntegration.createPostAndRefreshTimeline(postData)
   ```

3. **Set Up Real-time Updates**: Use the composable for real-time features:
   ```javascript
   import { useRealTimeUpdates } from '@/composables/useRealTimeUpdates'
   
   const realTimeUpdates = useRealTimeUpdates()
   realTimeUpdates.onPostCreated((post) => {
     // Handle real-time post creation
   })
   ```

### For Users
