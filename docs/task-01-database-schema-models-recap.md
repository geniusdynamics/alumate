### Model Relationships

```php
// Graduate relationships
Graduate::belongsTo(Course::class)
Graduate::belongsTo(Tenant::class)
Graduate::hasMany(JobApplication::class)

// Course relationships
Course::belongsTo(Tenant::class, 'institution_id')
Course::hasMany(Graduate::class)
Course::hasMany(Job::class)

// Job relationships
Job::belongsTo(Employer::class)
Job::belongsTo(Course::class)
Job::hasMany(JobApplication::class)

// JobApplication relationships
JobApplication::belongsTo(Job::class)
JobApplication::belongsTo(Graduate::class)

// Employer relationships
