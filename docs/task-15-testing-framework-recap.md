    /**
     * Create authenticated user for testing
     */
    protected function actingAsUser($role = 'graduate')
    {
        $user = User::factory()->create();
        
        switch ($role) {
            case 'graduate':
                Graduate::factory()->create(['user_id' => $user->id]);
