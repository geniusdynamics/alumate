# Alumni Tracking System - Frontend Architecture & Functionality Recap

## Project Overview

The Alumni Tracking System (Alumate) is a comprehensive Laravel 11 application with a modern Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend, designed to connect educational institutions, graduates, and employers in a unified platform.

## Recent Fixes & Improvements

### Component Naming Conflicts Resolution

**Issue**: The frontend was experiencing component naming conflicts that prevented proper loading, resulting in a blank screen.

**Root Cause**: Multiple components with identical names existed in different directories:
- `AppLogo.vue` (root) vs `AppLogo.vue` (common/)
- `AppLogoIcon.vue` (root) vs `AppLogoIcon.vue` (common/)
- `AppSidebar.vue` (root) vs `AppSidebar.vue` (layout/)
- `AppHeader.vue` (root) vs `AppHeader.vue` (layout/)
- `SuccessStoryCard.vue` (Scholarships/) vs `SuccessStoryCard.vue` (SuccessStories/)

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Renamed conflicting root-level components**:
   - `AppLogo.vue` → `SidebarLogo.vue`
   - `AppLogoIcon.vue` → `MainLogoIcon.vue`
   - `AppSidebar.vue` → `MainSidebar.vue`
   - `SuccessStoryCard.vue` (Scholarships) → `ScholarshipSuccessStoryCard.vue`

2. **Updated import references** in all affected files
3. **Fixed duplicate exports** in UI component index files
4. **Maintained common/ directory components** as primary implementations

### Vite Configuration Optimization

- Resolved unplugin-vue-components conflicts
