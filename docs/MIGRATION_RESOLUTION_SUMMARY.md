# Migration Resolution Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Duplicate Migration Files
- **Problem**: Multiple migrations trying to create the same tables
- **Resolution**: 
  - Removed duplicate `saved_searches` migration (2025_08_13_140000)
  - Created modification migration instead to update existing table
  - Removed duplicate `video_calls` stub migration (2025_08_14_213519)

### 2. Migration Dependency Issues
- **Problem**: Migrations referencing tables that didn't exist yet due to incorrect ordering
- **Resolution**:
  - Reordered `post_engagements` migration to come after `posts` migration
  - Moved `conversations` migration to come after `circles` and `groups` migrations
  - Moved all conversation-related migrations to proper order

### 3. Conflicting Table Structures
- **Problem**: New messaging system trying to create tables that already existed with different structures
- **Resolution**:
  - Removed duplicate conversation-based messaging migrations
  - Kept existing direct messaging system intact
  - Removed dependent migrations (conversation_participants, message_reads, etc.)
