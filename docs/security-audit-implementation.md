# Security Audit & Hardening Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of comprehensive security audit and hardening measures for the Modern Alumni Platform, addressing requirements 13.1, 13.2, and privacy/security compliance.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Security Testing Framework

#### Authentication Security Tests (`tests/Security/AuthenticationSecurityTest.php`)
- **Brute Force Protection**: Tests rate limiting on login attempts
- **Password Policy Enforcement**: Validates strong password requirements
- **Session Security**: Prevents session fixation and manages concurrent sessions
- **Account Lockout**: Implements progressive lockout policies
- **Email Verification**: Enforces verification for sensitive operations
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Tests 2FA integration and enforcement

#### Social Graph Security Tests (`tests/Security/SocialGraphSecurityTest.php`)
- **Post Visibility Controls**: Tests circle and group-based access controls
- **Profile Privacy**: Validates connection-based access restrictions
- **Data Harvesting Protection**: Prevents mass data extraction through pagination limits
- **Social Graph Enumeration**: Protects against user ID enumeration attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Tests social interaction rate limiting
- **Cross-Tenant Isolation**: Ensures tenant data separation

#### Data Privacy Tests (`tests/Security/DataPrivacyTest.php`)
- **GDPR Compliance**: Tests data export, deletion, and consent management
- **Data Encryption**: Validates sensitive data encryption at rest
- **Privacy Controls**: Tests granular privacy settings
- **Data Retention**: Implements automated cleanup policies
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
- **Cross-Border Transfer**: Validates international data transfer compliance

### 2. Social Rate Limiting Middleware (`app/Http/Middleware/SocialRateLimiting.php`)

#### Features
- **Action-Specific Limits**: Different rate limits for various social actions
  - Post creation: 10 per hour
  - Post interactions: 100 per 15 minutes
  - Connection requests: 20 per day
  - Messages: 50 per hour
  - Profile views: 200 per hour
  - Search queries: 100 per hour

#### Adaptive Rate Limiting
- **Trust Score Calculation**: Based on account age, verification status, profile completeness
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects suspicious patterns and automated behavior
- **Progressive Restrictions**: Reduces limits for untrusted users

#### Security Features
- **Bot Detection**: Identifies automated behavior patterns
- **Rapid-Fire Detection**: Flags unusual request patterns
- **IP and User Agent Analysis**: Monitors for suspicious access patterns

### 3. Security Audit Service (`app/Services/SecurityAuditService.php`)

#### Comprehensive Audit Capabilities
- **Authentication Security**: Password policies, session management, 2FA adoption
- **Authorization Controls**: Role-based access, tenant isolation, privilege escalation protection
- **Data Privacy**: Encryption, GDPR compliance, data retention policies
- **Social Graph Security**: Visibility controls, spam prevention, data harvesting protection
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, CORS configuration
- **Infrastructure Security**: HTTPS enforcement, security headers, file upload security

#### Data Integrity & Monitoring
- **Checksum Calculation**: SHA256 hashing for data integrity verification
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Monitors for unusual patterns
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates GDPR and privacy compliance reports
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security vulnerability detection

#### Privacy & Compliance Features
- **Data Processing Activities**: Tracks all data processing with legal basis
- **Cross-Border Transfer Validation**: Ensures international transfer compliance
- **Privacy Violation Scanning**: Automated detection of privacy breaches
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all security events

### 4. Database Schema Enhancements

#### Audit Logs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(id),
    action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    resource_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    resource_id BIGINT,
    ip_address INET NOT NULL,
    user_agent TEXT,
    metadata JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

#### Security Indexes
- User activity tracking: `(user_id, created_at)`
- Action-based queries: `(action, created_at)`
- Resource access: `(resource_type, resource_id)`

### 5. Middleware Integration

The `SocialRateLimiting` middleware has been registered in `bootstrap/app.php`:
```php
'social.rate_limit' => \App\Http\Middleware\SocialRateLimiting::class,
```

#### Usage Examples
```php
// Apply to specific social actions
Route::post('/posts', [PostController::class, 'store'])
    ->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'social.rate_limit:post_creation']);

Route::post('/posts/{post}/like', [PostController::class, 'like'])
    ->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'social.rate_limit:post_interaction']);
```
