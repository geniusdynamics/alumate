# Build Fix Summary

## Issue: vue-leaflet Package Resolution Error

The build was failing due to `vue-leaflet` package having incorrect main/module/exports in its package.json.

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Removed vue-leaflet Dependency
- ✅ **Removed from package.json**: `vue-leaflet` was not actually used in the codebase
- ✅ **Removed from Vite config**: Cleaned up manual chunks and optimizeDeps

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration
- ✅ **Added external handling**: Externalize any remaining vue-leaflet references
- ✅ **Improved leaflet support**: Kept leaflet (which is actually used) in optimizeDeps
- ✅ **Added Vue defines**: Proper Vue 3 configuration
- ✅ **Enhanced CSS handling**: Better CSS preprocessing options

### 3. Port Configuration (Previously Fixed)
- ✅ **Updated to port 5100**: All references updated from 5173 to 5100
- ✅ **Consistent configuration**: Vite, Laravel, and all scripts aligned

## Current Vite Configuration:

```typescript
// Key changes:
- Port: 5100 (was 5173)
- Host: 127.0.0.1
- Removed: vue-leaflet dependency
- Kept: leaflet (actually used in AlumniMap.vue)
- Added: External handling for problematic packages
- Enhanced: CSS and build optimization
```

## Next Steps:

### 1. Clean Install Dependencies
```bash
# Remove node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 2. Test Development Server
```bash
# Start Vite dev server on port 5100
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Production Build
```bash
# Test if build works now
npm run build
```

### 4. Verify Application
- **Development**: http://127.0.0.1:8080
- **Vite Dev Server**: http://127.0.0.1:5100 (assets only)

## Expected Results:

✅ **Build should complete successfully**
✅ **Development server should start on port 5100**
✅ **Frontend should load without blank screen**
✅ **AlumniMap component should work (uses leaflet)**

## If Issues Persist:

1. **Check for cached files**:
   ```bash
   npm run build -- --force
   ```

2. **Clear Vite cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   ```

3. **Verify no vue-leaflet imports**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "vue-leaflet" resources/js/
   ```

The build error should now be resolved with vue-leaflet removed and proper leaflet configuration maintained.
