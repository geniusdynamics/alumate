                          ->count();
        
        return $course->graduates->count() > 0 
            ? ($employed / $course->graduates->count()) * 100 
            : 0;
    }
}
```

### Course Management Controller
```php
class CourseController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $courses = Course::with(['graduates' => function($query) {
                            $query->select('id', 'course_id', 'employment_status');
                        }])
                        ->withCount('graduates')
                        ->paginate(15);

        return Inertia::render('Courses/Index', [
            'courses' => $courses,
            'filters' => request()->only(['search', 'status', 'department'])
        ]);
    }

    public function analytics(Course $course)
    {
        $analytics = $this->courseAnalyticsService
                         ->getCoursePerformanceMetrics($course->id);
        
        return Inertia::render('Courses/Analytics', [
            'course' => $course,
            'analytics' => $analytics,
            'trends' => $this->getTrendData($course)
        ]);
    }
}
```
