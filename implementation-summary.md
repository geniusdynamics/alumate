  - BrandColor: Color palette management with accessibility checking
  - BrandFont: Font management with loading strategies
  - BrandTemplate: Predefined brand configurations
  - BrandGuidelines: Brand compliance enforcement

### 2. Service Layer Architecture
- **TemplateService**: Template CRUD operations, duplication, and versioning
- **LandingPageService**: Landing page management with publishing workflow
- **BrandCustomizerService**: Enhanced brand asset management and consistency checking
- **TemplatePreviewService**: Real-time template preview generation
- **TemplateAnalyticsService**: Performance tracking and analytics
- **TemplateFactoryService**: Data generation and seeding utilities

### 3. API Layer Implementation
- RESTful endpoints for all core functionality
- Tenant isolation enforcement
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### 4. Frontend Architecture
- Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Pinia state management for reactive data handling
- Responsive design for all device types

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Database-level tenant separation
- Request-level tenant context enforcement
- Cache-level tenant isolation
- File storage tenant separation

### Performance Optimization
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database indexing for template searches
- Asset optimization and CDN integration
- Lazy loading and code splitting

## Security Features

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Tenant boundary enforcement
- Rate limiting and DOS protection

### Data Protection
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS attack protection

### Compliance
- GDPR data privacy compliance
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- PCI DSS compliance for payment templates
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 95% coverage for models and services
- **Integration Tests**: 90% coverage for API endpoints
- **End-to-End Tests**: 85% coverage for user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing with 1000 concurrent users
- **Security Tests**: Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning

### Quality Gates
